Latent Dirichlet Allocation Using 'tidyverse' Conventions

Copyright 2020 by Thomas W. Jones

Implements an algorithm for Latent Dirichlet Allocation using style conventions from the [tidyverse](https://style.tidyverse.org/) and [tidymodels](https://tidymodels.github.io/model-implementation-principles/). 
    
In addition this implementation of LDA allows you to:

* use asymmetric prior parameters alpha and beta
* use a matrix prior parameter, beta to seed topics into a model
* use a previously-trained model as a prior for a new model
* apply LDA in a transfer-learning paradigm, updating a model's parameters with additional data (or additional iterations)

Note that the seeding of topics and transfer learning are **experimental** for now. They are almost-surely useful but their behaviors have not been optimized or well-studied. Caveat emptor!

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("TommyJones/tidylda")
```

# Getting started

This package is still in its early stages of development. However, some basic functionality is below. Here, we will use the `tidytext` package to create a document term matrix, fit a topic model, predict topics of unseen documents, and update the model with those new documents.

`tidylda` uses the following naming conventions for topic models:

* `theta` is a matrix whose rows are distributions of topics over documents, or P(topic|document)
* `phi` is a matrix whose rows are distributions of tokens over topics, or P(token|topic)
* `gamma` is a matrix whose rows are distributions of topics over tokens, or P(topic|token)
  `gamma` is useful for making predictions with a computationally-simple and efficient dot product and it may be interesting to analyze in its own right.
* `alpha` is the prior that tunes `theta`
* `beta` is the prior that tunes `phi`
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(tidytext)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidylda)
library(Matrix)

### Initial set up ---
# load some documents
docs <- textmineR::nih_sample 

# tokenize using tidytext's unnest_tokens
tidy_docs <- docs %>% 
  select(APPLICATION_ID, ABSTRACT_TEXT) %>% 
  unnest_tokens(output = word, 
                input = ABSTRACT_TEXT,
                stopwords = stop_words$word,
                token = "ngrams",
                n_min = 1, n = 2) %>% 
  count(APPLICATION_ID, word) %>% 
  filter(n>1) #Filtering for words/bigrams per document, rather than per corpus

tidy_docs <- tidy_docs %>% # filter words that are just numbers
  filter(! stringr::str_detect(tidy_docs$word, "^[0-9]+$"))

# turn a tidy tbl into a sparse dgCMatrix 
# note tidylda has support for several document term matrix formats
d <- tidy_docs %>% 
  cast_sparse(APPLICATION_ID, word, n)

# let's split the documents into two groups to demonstrate predictions and updates
d1 <- d[1:50, ]

d2 <- d[51:nrow(d), ]

# make sure we have different vocabulary for each data set to simulate the "real world"
# where you get new tokens coming in over time
d1 <- d1[, colSums(d1) > 0]

d2 <- d2[, colSums(d2) > 0]

### fit an intial model and inspect it ----

set.seed(123)

lda <- tidylda(
  dtm = d1,
  k = 10,
  iterations = 200, 
  burnin = 175,
  alpha = 0.1, # also accepts vector inputs
  beta = 0.05, # also accepts vector or matrix inputs
  optimize_alpha = FALSE, # experimental
  calc_likelihood = TRUE,
  calc_r2 = TRUE, # see https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11061
  return_data = FALSE
)

# did the model converge?
# there are actual test stats for this, but should look like "yes"
qplot(x = iteration, y = log_likelihood, data = lda$log_likelihood, geom = "line")

# look at the model overall
glance(lda)

print(lda)

# it comes with its own summary matrix that's printed out with print(), above
lda$summary


# inspect the individual matrices
tidy_theta <- tidy(lda, matrix = "theta")

tidy_theta

tidy_phi <- tidy(lda, matrix = "phi")

tidy_phi

tidy_gamma <- tidy(lda, matrix = "gamma")

tidy_gamma

### predictions on held out data ---
# two methods: gibbs is cleaner and more techically correct in the bayesian sense
p_gibbs <- predict(lda, new_data = d2[1, ], iterations = 100, burnin = 75)

# dot is faster, less prone to error (e.g. underflow), noisier, and frequentist
p_dot <- predict(lda, new_data = d2[1, ], method = "dot")

barplot(rbind(gibbs = p_gibbs, dot = p_dot), beside = TRUE, col = c("red", "blue"))
legend("top", legend = c("Gibbs", "dot product"), fill = c("red", "blue"))


### updating the model ----
# now that you have new documents, maybe you want to fold them into the model?
lda2 <- update(
  object = lda, 
  dtm = d, # save me the trouble of manually-combining these by just using d
  iterations = 200, 
  burnin = 175,
  calc_likelihood = TRUE,
  calc_r2 = TRUE
)

# we can do similar analyses
# did the model converge?
qplot(x = iteration, y = log_likelihood, data = lda2$log_likelihood, geom = "line")

# look at the model overall
glance(lda2)

print(lda2)

# how does that compare to the old model?
print(lda)
```

I plan to have more analyses and a fuller accounting of the options of the various functions when I write the vignettes.

Planned updates include:

* an `augment` method to append distributions of `theta`, `phi`, or `gamma` to a tidy tibble of tokens
* various functions to compare topic models to evaluate the effects of `update`. (Although the functions will likely be general enough that you could compare any topic models.)

If you have any suggestions for additional functionality, changes to functionality, changes to arguments or other aspects of the API please let me know by opening an issue or sending me an email.
