## Initial version of tidylda
This is the first version of tidylda submitted to CRAN.
FWIW, I have two other packages on CRAN, textmineR and mvrsquared.
I know that this results in a manual check.
I will respond with any fixes or changes you deem necessary.
Thank you for taking the time and effort.

## Test environments
* local macOS install: release
* macOS (on GitHub actions): release

* win-builder: release, devel, and oldrel

## R CMD check results
